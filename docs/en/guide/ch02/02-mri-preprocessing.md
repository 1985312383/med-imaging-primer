# 2.2 MRI: k-Space Preprocessing

This page is a lightweight English counterpart to the MRI preprocessing chapter. It will be expanded with more detailed derivations and code examples.

Typical topics covered in k-space preprocessing:

- **Denoising / filtering** (noise statistics, coil noise)
- **Trajectory handling** (Cartesian vs non-Cartesian, gradient delays)
- **Phase correction** (EPI / ghosting-related corrections)
- **Unwrapping / padding** (to reduce ringing, improve conditioning)
- **Coil combination preparation** (sensitivity estimation, calibration data)
