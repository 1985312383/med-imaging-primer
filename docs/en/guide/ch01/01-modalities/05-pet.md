# 1.1.5 PET/SPECT: Metabolism & Function

PET and SPECT are **functional imaging** modalities: beyond anatomy, they visualize metabolism, perfusion, and receptor distribution using radioactive tracers.

## PET: coincidence detection and LOR

PET relies on positron annihilation:

1. Inject a positron-emitting tracer (e.g., **¹⁸F-FDG**)
2. Positron annihilates with an electron
3. Two **511 keV** photons are emitted ~180° apart
4. Coincidence detection forms a **Line of Response (LOR)**

Common tracers include **¹⁸F-FDG** and **⁶⁸Ga-PSMA**.

## PET-CT / PET-MRI

Hybrid imaging combines:

- anatomical localization (CT/MRI)
- attenuation correction and improved quantification

## SPECT: single photons + collimator

SPECT detects **single gamma photons** and uses a **collimator** to infer direction, trading sensitivity for directionality. It is widely used due to accessibility and mature clinical workflows (e.g., bone imaging, perfusion studies).
